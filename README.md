# About Me 
Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a former chemist and current associate in research software eningeering at Princeton University. I was drawn to software engineering when considering a career change because I love how challenging and fast paced it is. I'm looking forward to a career in tech where I am always learning new skills and challenging myself every day. Outside of coding, I like to read books, go running and hiking, and crochet. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
